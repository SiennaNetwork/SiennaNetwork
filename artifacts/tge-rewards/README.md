TODO: Optimize this directory. It currently contains:
* ephemeral artifacts (localnet state and receipts)
* non-ephemeral artifacts (performance profiles and non-localnet receipts)
* regenerated artifacts (by gh actions: test coverage and rendered docs)
* code to manage that zoo
  * where a "clearLocalnet" kind of function should be added
