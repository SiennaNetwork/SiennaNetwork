## Mainnet addresses

MOVED: See [receipts/README.md](./receipts/README.md#mainnet-addresses) for the up-to-date
mainnet addresses of all production contracts.

## Development quickstart

```sh
git clone git@git.sienna.network:siennanetwork/contracts.git sienna-contracts
cd sienna-contracts
git submodule update --init --recursive
nix-shell # optional, or bring your own Cargo and PNPM
pnpm i
pnpm -w dev build all
FADROMA_CHAIN=localnet-1.2 pnpm -w ops deploy all
```

The smart contracts are written in Rust, targeting SecretNetwork's fork of `cosmwasm-std 0.10`
on `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.

See [scripts/Dev.ts.md](./scripts/Dev.ts.md)
and [scripts/Ops.ts.md](./scripts/Ops.ts.md)
for the available workflow commands.

See also:
* **[Git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)** documentation,
  and most importantly the `git submodule update --init --recursive` command.
* THe **[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)** package manager, and most importantly
  its [Workspaces feature](https://pnpm.io/workspaces).

## Repository content

* [**artifacts**](./artifacts) contains the compiled smart contracts (gitignored)
  and their checksums (not gitignored).

* [**contracts**](./contracts) contains the Rust source code of the smart contracts,
  as well as the TypeScript code necessary to build them and interact with them.

    * [snip20-sienna](./contracts/tge/snip20-sienna) - Main SIENNA governance token
    * [mgmt](./contracts/tge/mgmt) - Vesting management contract
    * [rpt](./contracts/tge/rpt) - Remaining pool token splitter contract
    * [deploy.ts](./contracts/tge/deploy.ts) - TGE deployment

  * [ðŸ“„ amm](./contracts/amm) - **Automated Market Maker (AMM)**: Sienna Swap and friends
    * [amm-snip20](./contracts/amm/amm-snip20) - Vanilla SNIP20 token usable by the AMM

    * [market](./contracts/lend/market)
    * [oracle](./contracts/lend/oracle)
    * [overseer](./contracts/lend/overseer)
    * [interest_model](./contracts/lend/interest_model)

* [**deps**](./deps) contains submodules of our foundational frameworks.
  * [fadroma](./deps/fadroma) is a Git submodule pointing to the top of
    the Fadroma deployment framework, which takes care of building and uploading the
    contracts behind the scenes.

* [**frontends**](./frontends) contains clients for the smart contracts, written in JS/TS.
  Some of them are transcluded as git submodules pointing to other repos.
  * [siennajs](./frontends/siennajs) - current client library
  * [@sienna/api](./frontends/api) - upcoming mixed deploy/client library
  * [dashboard](./frontends/dashboard) - rewards simulation dashboard
  * [reward-pools-monitor](./frontends/reward-pools-monitor) - query status of reward pools
  * [claim](./frontends/claim) - TGE claim frontend
  * [vest](./frontends/vest) - TGE vest frontend

* [**libraries**](./libraries) contains Rust libraries used by one or more smart contracts.
  * [amm-shared](./libraries/amm-shared) defines the contract API of Sienna Swap.
  * [lend-shared](./libraries/lend-shared) defines the contract API of Sienna Lend.

* [**receipts**](./receipts) contains the responses to upload and init transactions
  performed by the framework, grouped by chain ID. This lets you keep track of uploaded
  contracts.
  * [secret-4/deployments/prod](./receipts/secret-4/deployments/prod) - current mainnet deployment
  * [pulsar-2/deployments/.active](./receipts/pulsar-2/deployments/.active) - current testnet deployment

* [**scripts**](./scripts) contains utility scripts pertaining to the whole repo.
  * [Dev.ts.md](./scripts/Dev.ts.md) - build and test with `pnpm -w dev`
  * [Ops.ts.md](./scripts/Ops.ts.md) - test and deploy with `pnpm -w ops`

* [**settings**](./settings) contains the values of configurable properties for each
  smart contract, again grouped by chain ID. This is a NPM module that can be imported
  by the deploy scripts to access the settings for deploying to a specific chain
  (as testnet configuration may need to systematically differ from mainnet).
  * [schedule.json](./settings/schedule.json) - vesting schedule

## Post-deployment configuration

After deployment the contracts should be
transferred to the master multisig account.
The CLI and API wrappers in this repo
do not support generating multisig transactions.

See [hackbg/motika](https://github.com/hackbg/motika)
for a GUI-based multisig transaction signer.
