    # This needs to be set up in two places:
    #   0. Generate a ssh key locally with `ssh-keygen -t rsa` (ed25519 seems not to work)
    #   1. Private key goes into organization secrets.
    #   2. Public key goes into service account public keys.
    #   3. Delete the generated SSH key from your local filesystem.

    # The usual `git submodule update --init --recursive` won't do. Here's why.
    # 1. The project repo lives on the private forge, and can have
    #    the correct submodule URLs in its root `.gitmodules` file.
    # 2. However, some of the public submodules live on GitHub, which
    #    does not let unauthenticated users clone over SSH, nor does it
    #    allow the same deploy key to be used across multiple repos.
    # 3. Those public submodules are also mirrored by the private forge,
    #    and it is preferable to use those mirrors rather than connect to GitHub.
    #    Therefore, the `.gitmodules` files of each submodule which has submodules
    #    need to be edited to point to the private forge URLs, rather than to the
    #    public GitHub URLs. Otherwise it is impossible to clone the submodules.
    # 4. Thankfully, there's only one level of this, in fact only one `.gitmodules`
    #    file needs to be updated.
