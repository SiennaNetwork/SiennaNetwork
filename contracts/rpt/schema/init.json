      "description": "Just a wrapped `Vec` with `get` and `insert` methods.\n\nActs as a KV map but serializes as an array of [K,V] pairs: * new keys are appended to the end, existing keys are updated in place * there is no check for keys being unique during deserialization * in case of duplicate keys, it's the 1st instance of a given key that \"counts\".\n\nIt's like this because `serde_json_wasm` doesn't serialize maps (`HashMap`, `BTreeMap`). This is true even in even in versions more recent than the default for SecretNetwork: the `serialize_map` method contains a single `unreachable!()` panic. It's not immediately obvious why this remains the case the case; perhaps iterating over of those is somehow more expensive on a blockchain? In any case, in the absence of gas benchmarks it's pointless to risk altering the default execution environment (of which `serde_json_wasm` is part), even though there's no obvious reason why that wouldn't work.",
