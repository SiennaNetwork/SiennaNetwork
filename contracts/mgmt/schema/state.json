This is true even in even in versions more recent than the default for SecretNetwork: the `serialize_map` method contains a single `unreachable!()` panic. It's not immediately obvious why this remains the case the case; perhaps iterating over of those is somehow more expensive on a blockchain? In any case, in the absence of gas benchmarks it's pointless to risk altering the default execution environment (of which `serde_json_wasm` is part), even though there's no obvious reason why that wouldn't work.",
